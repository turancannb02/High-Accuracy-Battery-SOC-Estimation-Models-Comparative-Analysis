## Data Preprocessing

The dataset used in this project includes battery data for different temperature and C-rate values. The data was processed using the [process_experimental_data.py](https://github.com/brosaplanella/TEC-reduced-model/blob/main/tec_reduced_model/process_experimental_data.py) file. Data preprocessing steps include standardization and conversion to sequences.

## Model Descriptions

### Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

The ANN model estimates battery SoC using features in the dataset. The model is designed as a three-layer artificial neural network. For detailed explanations and code, you can review the [Battery - ANN] file.

### Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

The RNN model estimates battery SoC using time series data. The model is trained with sequence data. For detailed explanations and code, you can review the [Battery - RNN] file.

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

The CNN model estimates battery SoC using convolutional layers. The model takes sequence data as input and predicts the SoC value as output. For detailed explanations and code, you can review the [Battery - CNN] file.

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

The LSTM model is a type of RNN designed to learn long-term dependencies. This model is used for battery SoC estimation. For detailed explanations and code, you can review the [Battery - LSTM] file.
